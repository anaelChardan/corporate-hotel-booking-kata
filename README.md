# Corporate Hotel Booking Kata

My attempt to this [kata](https://katalyst.codurance.com/corporate-hotel-booking)

Warning: I do not know Kotlin that much at that time.

## native Install

First you'll need gradle, it's easier to install it through SDKMAN!

```bash
sudo curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
sdk install gradle
```

## Testing

It uses [kotlintest](https://github.com/kotlintest/kotlintest/blob/v3.4.2/doc/reference.md) and [cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/installation/kotlin/) (`make acceptance`)
